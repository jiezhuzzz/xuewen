# Home Manager module for Xuewen. Exposed from the flake as
# `homeManagerModules.default` (which also fills in `services.xuewen.package`
# from the flake's build) and `homeManagerModules.xuewen` (this file; set
# `services.xuewen.package` yourself).
#
# Runs Xuewen as a per-user `systemd --user` service. Linux only: it relies on
# systemd user units, which Home Manager does not provide on Darwin. macOS
# users have the native desktop app (`xuewen-desktop`) instead.
#
# The option set and everything derived from it are shared with the NixOS
# module via ../lib.nix; this file is the user-unit flavor: state under $HOME
# and the reduced hardening set a user unit supports.
