/// Delete / undo / redo for the reader's marks, reachable from the global

/// Same shape and same reason as pdfCopy.ts: EmbedPDF binds no keys anywhere,
/// so every keystroke over the reader is this app's to handle, and the two
/// capabilities these commands need — annotations and history — are
/// registry-wide rather than per-tab. So the policy lives here, DOM-free and
/// dependency-injected; PdfDeck (one live instance, not one per tab) registers
/// the real capabilities; shortcuts.ts and keymap.ts call the free functions at
/// the bottom. The floating selection menu on the page calls the same
/// `deleteSelection`, so a mark removed with the trash button and one removed
/// with the Delete key take an identical path.
///
/// Nothing here may import pdfEngine.ts or any @embedpdf package: keymap.ts
/// imports this module, App.svelte imports keymap.ts, and the whole reader
/// tier (~5.8 MB) is deliberately behind a dynamic import in App.svelte. One
/// plugin import here would drag all of it into the library view's bundle.
/// That is also why ANNOTATION_HISTORY_TOPIC lives in this module rather than
/// beside the plugin registration it belongs to.

/// The topic the annotation plugin files its undo/redo commands under. Scoping
/// undo to it means an undo — from the toolbar buttons or from ⌘Z — can only
/// ever take back a mark, never whatever a future plugin puts on the same
/// global timeline. The plugin keeps this private (`ANNOTATION_HISTORY_TOPIC`
/// in annotation-plugin.d.ts), so the string is version-pinned to
/// @embedpdf/plugin-annotation 2.14.4; a rename upstream shows up as undo that
/// does nothing, not as a wrong undo.
