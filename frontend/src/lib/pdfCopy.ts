/// ⌘C over the reader. Copying a PDF selection is entirely this app's job:
/// EmbedPDF binds no keys anywhere, and the only clipboard write in the whole
/// package tree lives in an auto-mounted utility we deliberately don't register
/// (see pdfEngine.ts). The browser can't do it either — a page is an <img>
/// (RenderLayer/TilingLayer) and the selection overlay is empty pointer-events:
/// none <div>s, so the document selection over a page is always collapsed, the
/// copy command stays disabled, and no `copy` event is ever dispatched. There
/// is nothing to intercept; the keystroke has to be handled outright.
///
/// The text therefore has to be in hand BEFORE the keystroke. getSelectedText
/// is a PDFium `getTextSlices` round-trip through the worker, i.e. a full task
/// boundary, and a clipboard write on the far side of one has lost the user
/// gesture that authorized it (WebKit/WKWebView enforces this strictly, and
/// copyText's execCommand fallback needs the same live gesture). So the text is
/// fetched eagerly the moment a selection settles and cached here, and
/// `copySelection` writes it with no await in front of the write.
///
/// Kept DOM-free and dependency-injected so the whole policy is unit-testable;
/// PdfDeck supplies the real capability and `copyText`.

/// The plugin surface this module needs, declared structurally rather than
/// imported as `SelectionCapability`. Two reasons, both load-bearing: the real
/// `PdfTask` aliases a class with private fields, so a `{ toPromise }` fake can
/// never satisfy it and `npm run check` fails on the test (the same reason
/// loadCitations.ts declares `EngineLike`); and the capability's event hooks are
/// typed `EventHook<T>`, a *union* of two call signatures, which does not
/// assign to a plain method under strictFunctionTypes.
