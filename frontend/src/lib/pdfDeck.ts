 *  the registry initializes, then — the instant `pluginsReady` flips — again
 *  inside the AutoMount wrapper, which is where the annotation plugin's
 *  `RendererRegistryProvider` comes from, so it can't simply be turned off with
 *  `autoMountDomElements={false}`. That branch swap destroys and recreates the
 *  whole subtree, handing the new PdfDeck a fresh, EMPTY `opened` set. It then
 *  opened the active paper a second time, and the second load's `setAnnotations`
 *  replaced the annotation plugin's document map wholesale — wiping every mark
 *  the first load had already imported from the sidecar, which is why saved
 *  annotations came back for about a second and then vanished. The registry
 *  survives the remount, so it, not a component-local Set, is the authority on
 *  what is already open; `documentOrder` carries an id from the moment loading
 *  starts, so an open still in flight counts too.
 *
 *  Only ids that belong to a tab are adopted. The registry also holds the
 *  throwaway `export:<paper id>` document while an annotated PDF is being built
 *  (annotationExport.ts); adopting that would put it in `opened`, where the very
 *  next reconcile would see no tab for it and close it mid-export. */

 *  concurrency 1) at CRITICAL priority — above renderPage — and a started task
 *  is never preempted. So each background tab's parse lands *ahead* of the
 *  visible tab's page rasters, and a session restored with four tabs paints
 *  nothing until all four have been parsed and their pages rasterized: the
