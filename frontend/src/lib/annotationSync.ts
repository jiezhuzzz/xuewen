/// ours — the rows we imported, plus the marks the user drew this session — and
/// persists nothing else. Foreign marks stay visible but read-only in effect:
/// `autoCommit: false` means an edit to one was never going to reach the PDF
/// anyway, so nothing is lost that was ever going to be kept.
